# COVID-19 Deaths & Vaccination Analysis (MySQL)
### Overview

This project analyzes global COVID-19 deaths and vaccination data using MySQL. The objective is to demonstrate practical SQL skills, including large data ingestion, schema design, data validation, and analytical querying on real-world datasets.

The data is sourced from Our World in Data and was imported into MySQL using command-line tools to handle large CSV files efficiently.

### Dataset

  Source: https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths

### Files used:

* CovidDeaths.csv

* CovidVaccinations.csv

### Tools & Technologies

* MySQL

* Git Bash / Command Prompt

* MySQL Workbench 

### Key Analysis Performed

* Country-wise and date-wise analysis of COVID-19 cases and deaths

* Identification of high-impact locations based on cumulative metrics

* Integration of deaths and vaccination datasets

* Calculation of cumulative vaccinations using window functions

* Derivation of vaccination coverage as a percentage of population

## Key SQL Concepts Used

* LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE for large CSV ingestion

* Table schema design and data validation

* JOIN operations

* Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

* Window functions (SUM() OVER)

* Views for reusable analytical logic


### Outcome

This project demonstrates an end-to-end SQL workflow, from raw data ingestion to analytical insights, reflecting real-world data analysis practices using MySQL.
